# Finding similar items

## About
This project is based on the assignment of the module _Algorithms for Massive Data Analysis_ and aims to construct a detector of similar items using **Apache Pyspark**. 
The data is taken by [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024) which contains several csv files on job posts from LinkedIn. The one chosen for this task was the _job_summary.csv_ which contains two columns _job_link_ and _job_summary_ that represents the descriptions of the jobs.

## Support
